The game is around the player, who's a child who woke up inside a liminal and eerily quite playground at 2:17 a.m. 
Their goal is to try to escape without 'the creature' realizing you're there. The player will have three options for what to do. 1. Play around with the shadows, on slides, swings, until day comes. 2. Figure out secrets, hints on how to wake up. 3. Stand still. Keep swinging
I could implement these elements into the game with one page, with three components: Index, style, and script. Title: "The Playground at 2:17." The player, swings, and other mechanics could be in the body.
