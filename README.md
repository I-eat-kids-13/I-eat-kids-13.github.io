The game is around the player, who's a child who woke up inside a liminal and eerily quite playground at 2:17 a.m. 
Their goal is to try to escape without 'the creature' realizing you're there. The player will have three options for what to do.
1. Play around with the shadows, on slides, swings, until day comes.
2. Figure out secrets, hints on how to wake up.
3. Stand still. Keep swinging.

I could implement these elements into the game with one page, with three components: Index, style, and script. Title: "The Playground at 2:17." The player, swings, and other mechanics could be in the body. 
Idea of lay out: The game, in a rectangle-like screen, could be a picture of a playground. Hovering over an item or place (example: swings, slides) could highlight the item. Once clicking, it could be a link to a new picture, showing the item. (example: clicking on the swings take you closer) 
NPCs: I would like to have atleast one, but two Npcs would be greta. And idea for one is a child made of shadow, one that randomly appears on on the swings maybe, or once you click the slide, they'll be there next to you. Voiclines could be: "You go first," "It's your turn," "[Laughter]"
Slide: If you click on the slide, it'll give two options: 'Go down?' or 'Go back.' Clicking on 'Go back' will take you back to the homepage on the playground. Clicking 'Go down' will take you to the bottom of the slide, text saying 'You went down, go again?' clicking the text will take you back to the start of the slide, the same options of 'Go down' and 'Go back' on the screen.
